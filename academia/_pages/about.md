I am a computer science researcher and postgraduate student at BITS Pilani (M.Sc. Data Science & AI), building human-centric technology at the intersection of systems, intelligence, and design.

With an M.Tech in Information Technology from IIIT Gwalior, a cleared GATE and UGC NET (CS), and a brief stint in industry at EXL as a developer working on low-code enterprise systems, I've found myself drawn equally toward teaching and building.

My interests drift across cybersecurity (CEH certified, VAPT), a bit of game development, competitive programming, and the occasional foray into fiction writing and wildlife photography. I believe good technology should feel invisible — not because it hides, but because it fits.

Currently working on [Project BAY](https://github.com/gv1shnu/project-bay) — an ethical betting platform centred around self-imposed growth and accountability.
